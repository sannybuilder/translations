## How To Translate

### Using Translation Tool (preferred)
Use a web tool at https://translate.sannybuilder.com which is designed to work with Sanny Builder translation files, highlight missing entries and save your progress.

### Manual Translation
* The English translation is always the most up-to-date.
* Create a copy of the _english.ini_ file and give it the name of a language you want to translate into (for example _german.ini_, _french.ini_, etc).
* Assign a correct value for the _LANGID=X_ parameter, where _X_ is the Language ID (in the decimal format). To find out the Language ID visit this website: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964664
* Translate the text. DO NOT edit line identifiers and section names.
* Save the changes. The new translation should be accessible in the Sanny Builder Options under the name that you assigned via the Language ID.
